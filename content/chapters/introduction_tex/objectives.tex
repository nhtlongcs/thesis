\label{sec:objectives}

The proposed method for interactive ct volume segmentation is satisfying all designed goals, including fast, limited propagated times to satisfy results, the results are always exactly comparable to the annotator level. Besides, we do experiment a annotation tool with the proposed algorithm. The annotation tool can be used to provide an intuitive interface for users to interactively mark regions of interest on a 3D image and has been found effective in our study.
