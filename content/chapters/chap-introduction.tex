\begin{ChapAbstract}
% In this chapter, there are four sections that aim to provide general information about our work before getting into the details in next chapters.
% The first section (\ref{sec:overview}) will demonstrate the practicality and applicability of two separate, but related, fields.
% Following that, in section \ref{sec:motivation}, we will discuss our motivation in two aspects: (i) explain why our task, which is a combination of mentioned fields, is vital in real life and (ii) the limitations of current techniques applicable to this problem.
% Section \ref{sec:objectives} is responsible for describing how we build different modules to tackle the problem.
% The final section (\ref{sec:thesis_content}) is a summary outline of our thesis.
