\chapter{Background}
\label{chap-background}
\begin{ChapAbstract}
In this chapter, we discuss all necessary background knowledge related to our work. First of all, we start with the very beginning concept in machine learning and then introduce some fundamental models used in processing complex data such as time-series or digital images. Then we introduce a list of Computer Vision problems which play an important role in our proposed approach.
