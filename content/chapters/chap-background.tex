\begin{ChapAbstract}
In this chapter, we discuss all necessary concepts and topics related to our work. 
In the first section, we start with the very beginning concept in machine learning and then introduce some fundamental models used in processing complex data such as natural language or digital images. 
Then we introduce a list of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing problems which play an important role in our proposed system.
