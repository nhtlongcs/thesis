\begin{ChapAbstract}

In this chapter, we report the results and discuss about the future works for improving our proposed method and its applications. In our thesis, we proposed a novel pipeline to tackle the problem of CT volume organ segmentation along with an interactive tool that can help labeling process become less complicated. Overall, through ablation study, our method shows improvements over the original baseline, yet still have weaknesses. If these shortcomings can be resolved, we believe it can bring many breakthrough for both the deep leaning and medical fields. Having said that, it is left for the future works.
