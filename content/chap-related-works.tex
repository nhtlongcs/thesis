\begin{ChapAbstract}
In this chapter, we first introduce the video-text retrieval problem, which is most related to our work. We also discuss the representation learning based approaches which are widely used to solve this task and details about the state-of-the-art framework that we utilized in our work in section \ref{sec:common_ret}. 
Next, we introduce related works which share the same objectives and motivation to solve the vehicle retrieval challenge in section \ref{sec:ai_city}.
In the last two sections, we provide detailed discussions about the Multiple Object Tracking and Semantic Role Labeling task that applied to extract multimodal cues in our system (section \ref{sec:mot} and section \ref{sec:srl}).
